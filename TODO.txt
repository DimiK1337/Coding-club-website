Projects page:
- Adding projects with a form:
    - The user will need to enter a project title
    - The author of the project
    - Use JS to add the date it was uploaded
    - If a project has a link, then we will need an option for the project's link
    - On submit, the form data will be sent to a database
- Retreiving projects on load of page:
    - Figure out way to add new projects
